# Deep Learning Simulator 2021

Explore the strange world of deep learning with this state of the art simulator. Your goal is to get the training data as deep as possible into the network to maximize the layer effect. To do this you can adjust some parameters of the network on-the-fly in order to guide your data. However, the results are needed quickly, and there are only so many preliminary results you can publish to extend your deadline.

## How to play
Get the data-wheel as deep as possible (depth is displayed at the top of the screen, together with all time highscore). Click and drag to add new cells to guide the data. Click on a cell to remove it (this costs the same as two new cells). Don't let the data touch the red cells. You have only a limited time (refill with yellow pills) and cells (refill with green pills). The maximal available time can be increased by collecting magenta pills.

**Hint**: try the desktop version in order to get slightly better graphics.
